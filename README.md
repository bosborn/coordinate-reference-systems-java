# GeoPackage Core Java

#### GeoPackage Core Libs ####

The GeoPackage Libraries were developed at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) in collaboration with [BIT Systems](https://www.bit-sys.com/index.jsp). The government has "unlimited rights" and is releasing this software to increase the impact of government investments by providing developers with the opportunity to take things in new directions. The software use, modification, and distribution rights are stipulated within the [MIT license](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/).

### About ###

GeoPackage Core provides core functionality for GeoPackage implementations of the Open Geospatial Consortium [GeoPackage](http://www.geopackage.org/) [spec](http://www.geopackage.org/spec/).

It is the core library of both the [GeoPackage Android](https://github.com/ngageoint/geopackage-android) SDK and [GeoPackage Java](https://github.com/ngageoint/geopackage-java) library.

### Usage ###

#### GeoPackage Android ####

The [GeoPackage Android](https://github.com/ngageoint/geopackage-android) SDK is an Android GeoPackage implementation.

#### GeoPackage SDK Sample ####

The [GeoPackage MapCache](https://github.com/ngageoint/geopackage-mapcache-android) app provides an Android example of using the [GeoPackage Android](https://github.com/ngageoint/geopackage-android) SDK.

#### GeoPackage Java ####

The [GeoPackage Java](https://github.com/ngageoint/geopackage-java) library is a Java GeoPackage implementation.
